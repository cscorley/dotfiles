My dotfiles. Everything in this repo is probably useless to you. It serves as
a repo for me to keep my crap. This is over-engineered. 

To use:

    git clone https://github.com/cscorley/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    make install

Or automagically:

    curl -L https://github.com/cscorley/dotfiles/raw/master/setup.sh | sh
